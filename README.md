# Android Mobile Gaming Showcase

The Android app offers users the chance to play three classic games, each designed with a unique flair and modern interface.

## Features

- **TicTacToe**: An all-time classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

- **Wordle**: A challenging word puzzle game where players guess a five-letter word within six attempts, receiving feedback on each guess. Inspired by the classic game of the same name.

- **Blackjack**: Dive into the world of cards with this casino classic. Try to reach a hand value of 21 without going over, and hope the dealer doesn't have a better hand!
